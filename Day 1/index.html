    <p>Frontend development is the part of web development that focuses on the look and feel of a website — everything that users see and interact with on their screens. 
    From the layout and colors to the fonts, images, and animations, frontend developers are responsible for designing a smooth and enjoyable user experience.
    To build the frontend of a website, developers mainly use three core technologies: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.<br><br>
    1 HTML (HyperText Markup Language) provides the basic structure of the webpage. <br>
    2 CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style the layout, design, and overall appearance. <br>
    3 JavaScript adds interactivity to the page — like dropdowns, buttons, sliders, and animations. <br><br>
    The goal of a frontend developer is to make a website not only look good but also be easy to use. 
    A good website should load fast, work on all screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop), and be accessible to everyone.
    As a student, starting with frontend development is a great first step into the tech world.
